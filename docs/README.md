# Project Documentation for .NET Project

## 1. Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive overview of our .NET project. The project is a web-based application designed to solve a specific problem. The primary motivation behind this project is to provide an efficient and user-friendly solution to the problem. The goal is to provide a platform that is easy to use, scalable, and maintainable.

## 2. Project Architecture
The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern. The architecture is divided into three major components: Models, Views, and Controllers. The Models represent the application data and business logic, the Views display the data to the user, and the Controllers handle user input and interactions.

## 3. Installation and Setup
To install and configure the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have the correct .NET version installed.
2. Clone the project repository.
3. Install any dependencies listed in the project's `package.json` file.
4. Configure your environment variables as per the project's `config` file.
5. Run the project locally using the command `dotnet run`.

## 4. Code Structure
The project's directory structure is organized as follows:

- `/Controllers`: Contains all the controller classes.
- `/Models`: Contains all the model classes.
- `/Views`: Contains all the view files.
- `/wwwroot`: Contains all the static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images.

Each class and method in the project serves a specific purpose. For example, the `UserController` class handles user-related operations, and its `CreateUser` method is responsible for creating a new user.

## 5. Features and Functionality
The core features of the project include user registration, user login, data visualization, and data export. Each feature is implemented using specific classes and methods.

*Code snippets and examples for each feature*

## 6. API Documentation
The project exposes a REST API with endpoints for user registration, user login, data retrieval, and data export. Each endpoint supports specific HTTP methods and requires certain parameters.

## 7. Error Handling
Errors and exceptions in the project are handled using custom error classes and methods. The `CustomErrorHandler` class logs all exceptions and provides meaningful error messages to the user.

## 8. Testing and Quality Assurance
The project uses the NUnit testing framework for unit testing and integration testing. To run the tests, use the command `dotnet test`.

## 9. Performance and Optimization
The project is optimized for performance using caching, lazy loading, and efficient database queries. Performance metrics are available in the `PerformanceMetrics` class.

## 10. Contributing Guidelines
To contribute to the project, follow the Gitflow branching strategy. All code changes should be made in a separate branch and submitted as a pull request. All pull requests are reviewed before being merged into the main branch.

## 11. Licensing and Legal
The project is licensed under the MIT license. All contributors must agree to abide by the terms of the license.
